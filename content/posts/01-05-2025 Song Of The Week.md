Welcome to my first official post on my website. I thought over what exactly I wanted  my first post to be and decided I wanted to just post whatever music I'm listening to while editing my Website. I been playing a lot of Persona recently so these two songs are stuck in my head. 

**This is technically two song but whatever.**
