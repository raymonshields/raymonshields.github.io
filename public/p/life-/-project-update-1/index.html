First of all because of my new work schedule I will be updating the website mainly on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So three post a week with Monday being a main update of what happened last week, Wednesday being smaller updates and Friday being Song Of The Week. I may still update the website with anything interesting like a new release of a game I love, interesting tech or anything else interesting. In addition at the end of the month I will release a Collection Update showing all the new games, DVDs/Blu-rays, Books and other that I acquired during that month. Along with that a Progress Report / LIFE Update will happen every two week to give updates on projects and how life is going for me. This is definitely alot to keep up with but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that after a month of doing this consistently I will eventually develop a habit &amp; and it would just become second nature. Anyways I won&rsquo;t waste any more of your time about my website, time to talk about my new job.\n">

<p><strong>Life is good so far. That&rsquo;s it if you want the short answer. This Post is more in lines of a Project Update instead of a LIFE UPDATE so if you want to learn more about what I&rsquo;m working on then feel free to continue reading&hellip; (warning this is long)</strong></p>
<h2 id="quick-website-update">Quick Website Update
</h2><p>Before we get started with my new job I wanted to let you all know that I will be imposing a upload schedule to my website because there is so much I want to get done. First of all because of my new work schedule I will be updating the website mainly on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So three post a week with Monday being a main update of what happened last week, Wednesday being smaller updates and  Friday being Song Of The Week. I may still update the website with anything interesting like a new release of a game I love, interesting tech or anything else interesting. In addition at the end of the month I will release a Collection Update showing all the new games, DVDs/Blu-rays, Books and other that I acquired during that month. Along with that a Progress Report / LIFE Update will happen every two week to give updates on projects and how life is going for me. This is definitely alot to keep up with but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that after a month of doing this consistently I will eventually develop a habit &amp; and it would just become second nature. Anyways I won&rsquo;t waste any more of your time about my website, time to talk about my new job.</p>

<h2 id="life--job">Life / Job
</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve just started working as a Data Center Technician as of three weeks ago and it&rsquo;s been just an influx of information thrown at me via online training. The drive to said Data Center is definitely long with a estimate time of about 2 hours to the Center and 2 hours back. But when I actual get to work with my crewmates it is great. The people here are more engaging, more willing to talk, share information, help you out and overall just talk. It&rsquo;s an interesting departure from any of the other jobs I&rsquo;ve worked at. I&rsquo;m currently a still a trainee and my training last about a year after which I get promoted and get paid more. But no matter what the experience is worth.</p>
<h2 id="main-channel--momodora-review-update">Main Channel &amp; Momodora Review Update
</h2><p>I still need to upload a video for my personal YouTube channel even if it&rsquo;s something short. I originally thought I can just upload a random video and that would be it but in the end I ended up not posting anything not knowing what to post. I&rsquo;m deciding between some bowling clips or just a random video of a cat on the roof of my car. Whatever i choose i will upload it before Monday so look out for that. Other than that I decided to make a gaming channel where I post gameplay, reviews &amp; anything else gaming related. I wanted to separate my personal content and gaming content because I want my family members to be able to subscribe to my channel without worrying about having to comb through the sea of gaming or collecting videos to reach a actual video.</p>
<p>Speaking on my gaming channel I&rsquo;m still working on my Momodora Series Review. I still trying to get use to using DaVinci Resolve along with finding new ways to express my thoughts. I haven&rsquo;t had to write a essay or really express my feeling on paper/online since like High School. I&rsquo;m trying to get back to writing so I can expand my vocabulary and to overall not regress in my ability to express myself. My hope is that using a median that I&rsquo;m familiar with and love it makes it easier to write. So far progress is slow as I currently in the research phase, going through all the Momodora games and researching the development of each Momodora game is definitely time consuming. At the same time I been debating making one huge video review or splitting it up between 5 to 6 videos (one for each game). I&rsquo;ll continue down the path of one video for now but I&rsquo;ll communicate If I switch it from one to many, so stay in tune for that.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="other-projects--videos-planned">Other Projects / Videos Planned
</h2><p>Now that I&rsquo;m done talking about Momodora Review I wanted to to bring up a some other project I have planned or is in the works. Just so you know not everything here is 100% going to become a Project that I&rsquo;ll post publicly. Some of these projects could be mentioned here and just becomes a private project but i want to just get some stuff off my mind and onto paper (or online in this case).</p>
<h3 id="1-starting-a-nas">1. Starting A NAS
</h3><p>A Network Attached Server (NAS) is a server hosted locally on your personal network that allow you to do all sort of incredible things like hosting your own Media Server, running a Minecraft Server, using HOMELAB (a software), or just as a Mass Media Drive. The main reason I want to create a NAS is to have a separate storage drive anyone can access and in order to run a Plex Server. Plex allows you to play video files hosted on your PC to anyone connect to the network / account. The Plex Server alone is worth it because using my PC&rsquo;s Blu-ray player I can extract my DVD/Blu-ray content and have my own personal Netflix at home. For example If I have Breaking Bad on blu-ray I can rip it using my blu-ray player like I&rsquo;m ripping a Music CD and sort the episodes so that I can add it to Plex and access the show without have to pay for a Subscription service [Plex is Free]. This is allows me to access the uncompressed Blu-ray rips for TV Shows &amp; Movies rather than going through a streaming service that will compress and degrade the quality because It has to serve all these video to so may customer.</p>
<p>The main thing holding me back thou is easily the cost of everything. In order to host the huge amount of Data I demand I would need more than 36TB configured in RAID 2 (RAID 2 = 18TB of storage with another 18TB working as a fail-safe in case I lose data). This includes all my DVD/Blu-ray rips, raw  video &amp; audio recordings (real life and game recordings), ripped Video Game Disc (PS3, GameCube, Wii &amp; More) &amp; Project Files.</p>
<p>Each DVD disc is 4.7 GB extracted, Blu-ray disks are anywhere from 20GB - 50 GB &amp; 4K Blu-rays are 50GB-100GB. I will use a Handbrake in order to get rid of any padding &amp; compress the file without any major quality loss. And even then these files can still be upwards of 10GB. So for this project I will be using Enterprise HDD (Hard Disk Drives) using <a class="link" href="https://serverpartdeals.com"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >https://serverpartdeals.com</a>. I chose to use Server Part Deals because all the Drives are rated for use in Data Centers &amp; will last longer than a regular off the shelf HDD. But as you can see the price in of itself is an investment The drives alone don&rsquo;t account for the fact that I still need to build a separate PC with 10GB Networking and enough processing to run 4K content and anything else I throw at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stop here but I may make a separate post in order to get real in depth on how ripping Blu-rays work and encoding. Thanks for bearing with me though.</p>
<h3 id="2-comptia-certs">2. CompTIA Certs
</h3><p>This one is a short one but I want to go ahead and get my other CompTIA certs. I already have my Security+ 601 (acquired in <em><strong>Jan 2024</strong></em>) but I wanted to go back and get my other certs since they are technically easier than the Security+. In order from easiest to hardest I will be getting my: <strong>Tech+, A+ (Part 1), A+ (Part 2), Networking</strong>.

<h3 id="3-collection-video">3. Collection Video
</h3><p>Not mention in my YouTube section is that I also have plans on doing a full Blu-ray collection showcase with context on why I bought certain show and movies. This is something I want to create for a while but I need a few things before this project becomes a reality. I already made a deal with my brother for his Sony camera but I would still need to learn how to use it and how to create stable shots and manage multiple video files. This is another reason I&rsquo;m making my Momodora Review video, because it helps for getting ready to manage multiple clips especially since I can see my Collection Video being broke up easily into three or more multi-hour long videos.</p>
<h3 id="4-love2d">4. LOVE2D
</h3><p>This project is something I&rsquo;m doing mainly for fun &amp; is just a private project but I wanted to mention it as it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve used before but I wanted to create a small RPG Game just to put some of my ideas into a game.</p>
